# The PHP Interpreter

PHP is a general-purpose scripting "language" that is not especially suited to
web development. Neither fast, flexible nor pragmatic, PHP unfortunately powers everything from your
blog to the most popular websites in the world. PHP is distributed under the
[PHP License v3.01](LICENSE).
